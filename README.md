## Written Report

## Summary of the Analysis

Working with the data from two files: schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv, two dataframes were created for a District Summary and a School Summary. School performance was based on math and reading scores. Different areas that were investigated were: highest and bottom performing schools, and scores by school: spending, size, and type.

## Two Conclusions/Comparisons from the Calculations

1) As far as school size, small and medium sized schools out-performed large schools on passing overall, 89-90% versus 58%.

2) As far as charter versus public schools, charter schools out-performed public schools on passing overall, 90% versus 53%.
